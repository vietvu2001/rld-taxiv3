- This file collects the training data needed for Supervised Learning. We create environments using random vectors of modifications (fixed number of iterations), and evaluate them using Q-Learning agents. To specify how many modifications are allowed, modify line ```95```, along with line ```85``` to figure out how many rounds you want to do (based on the number of environments you want to generate).
