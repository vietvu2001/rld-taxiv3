# Project

This repository contains the code for my project, Three Methods for Reinforcement Learning Design.

# Packages to install
- gym: provides text-based representation render through utils
- tensorflow: training ANN for the Supervised Learning method
- termcolor
- sklearn: provides the function train_test_split for separating training - testing data

# Usage
1. Supervised Learning
- First, run allstates.py to store sampled data to data_3.csv
- Then, run feed.py to train the ANN and return the result of this method in sl_result_4 (budget is 4).
- Dynamic version (allowing dynamic budget changes) will be updated shortly.
